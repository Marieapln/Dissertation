### R Shiny App - Dashboard and statistical modeling 

This page contains the code and input data for an app built for suicide trend analysis. 
The first tab of the app enables interactive data visualisation whilst the second
tab allows the user to fit a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to explore the influence of
socio-economic variables on suicide mortality. The countries to include
in the model can be manually selected. The user can also choose to analyse country
groupings from clusters obtained through the mclust package.

The link to the app is the following:
